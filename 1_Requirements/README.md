# OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROJECT :
Solar trackers are used to keep solar collectors/panels aligned with the sun as it moves around the sky every day. Solar Trackers improve the energy output of the heat/electricity generated by increasing the amount of solar energy received by the solar energy collector
# INTRODUCTION 
As nonrenewable energy supplies become scarcer, renewable energy sources are increasingly used to generate electricity. Solar panels are getting increasingly popular.We've already read an article on how to set up solar panels at home. A solar panel gathers solar energy, converts it to electrical energy, and then stores it in a battery.
This energy can be used as needed or as a straight replacement for grid-supplied electricity. The applications that make use of the energy stored in batteries are listed below.
Because of the Earth's rotation, the Sun's location in relation to the solar panel is not fixed. Solar panels should absorb as much energy as possible in order to make the most efficient use of solar energy.
This is only possible if the panels are always pointing in the direction of the Sun. As a result, the solar panel should revolve towards the direction of the Sun at all times. The circuit that rotates a solar panel is described in this article.
# PRINCIPLE OF SUN TRACKING PANEL
* Two LDRs, a solar panel, a servo motor, and an ATmega328 Microcontroller make up the Sun tracking solar panel.
* On the solar panel's edges, two light-dependent resistors are positioned. 
* When light falls on a light dependent resistor, it produces a low resistance. 
* The panel is rotated in the direction of the Sun by a servo motor connected to it. 
* The panel is set up in such a way that the light from two LDRs is compared, and the panel is rotated towards the LDR with the highest intensity, i.e. the least resistance. 
* The panel is rotated at a specific angle using a servo motor.
* When the light intensity on the right LDR is higher, the panel slowly travels to the right, and when the light intensity on the left LDR is higher, the panel gently goes to the left. 
* The sun is ahead at noon, and the intensity of light on both panels is the same. In such circumstances, the panel remains stationary and does not rotate.
